## About Me
With over a decade of experience as a Web-based Software Engineer, I have honed
my skills and expertise in the dynamic field of web development. By day, I am
a dedicated website administrator for a prominent uniformed youth organization
in the picturesque landscapes of Scotland. In my spare time, I channel my passion
into my own Web development business, collaborating with a diverse array of
clients across Scotland to enhance their digital operations and drive success.

<!--I am now seeking a thrilling opportunity that will enable me to relocate to
the enchanting Netherlands, a country that has captured my heart with its vibrant
culture, picturesque scenery, and innovative spirit.-->

Additionally, I am deeply intrigued by the transformative potential of machine
language models and their applications, or "AI", as marketing indivials have
named them. I am keen on exploring how its proper application can serve as a
genuine boon to society and individual content creators, driving progress and
innovation in our ever-changing digital age.
